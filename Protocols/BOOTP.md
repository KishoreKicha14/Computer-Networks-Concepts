BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) is a networking protocol that is used to assign IP addresses to devices on a network and to provide other configuration information to devices during the boot process. BOOTP is an older protocol and it is not widely used today, it has been mostly replaced by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

BOOTP is similar to RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol), in that it is used to assign IP addresses to devices that do not have the capability to store their IP address in non-volatile memory. However, BOOTP provides more functionality than RARP.

When a device starts up, it sends a BOOTP request to the BOOTP server on the network, asking for its IP address and other configuration information. The BOOTP server receives the request and looks up the device's MAC address in its database, which contains a mapping of MAC addresses to IP addresses and other configuration information.

Once the BOOTP server finds the IP address and other configuration information associated with the MAC address, it sends a BOOTP reply containing the device's IP address and other configuration information to the requesting device.

The device then uses the received IP address and configuration information to configure its network interface and communicate with other devices on the network.

BOOTP provides more functionality than RARP, such as the ability to assign IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and other configuration information to devices, and also the ability to send boot files to diskless workstations.

As mentioned before, BOOTP is not widely used today, as DHCP is more efficient and secure, it provides more functionality such as the ability to assign IP addresses dynamically, which can ease the management of IP addresses and reduce IP conflicts.
