RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is a protocol that maps a physical address (MAC address) to a logical address (IP address). It works in a similar way to ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), but in reverse.

When a device starts up, it sends a RARP request to the RARP server on the network, asking for its IP address. The RARP request contains the device's MAC address, which is used to identify the device.

The RARP server receives the request and looks up the device's MAC address in its database. The RARP server's database contains a mapping of MAC addresses to IP addresses.

Once the RARP server finds the IP address associated with the MAC address, it sends a RARP reply containing the device's IP address to the requesting device.

The device then uses the received IP address to configure its network interface and communicate with other devices on the network.

It's worth noting that RARP is an older protocol and it is not widely used today, it has been replaced by BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) which provide more functionality, such as the ability to assign IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and other configuration information to devices, making it more efficient and secure.
