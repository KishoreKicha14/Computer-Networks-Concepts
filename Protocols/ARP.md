ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a protocol used to map a network layer protocol address (such as an IP address) to a link layer protocol address (such as a MAC address) on a local area network (LAN).

When a device wants to communicate with another device on a LAN, it needs to know the physical address (MAC address) of the destination device. ARP allows a device to broadcast a request on the network asking for the physical address (MAC address) of a specific IP address. The device with that IP address will respond with its physical address (MAC address), allowing the two devices to communicate.

The ARP process can be broken down into the following steps:

A device, let's say Device A, wants to send a message to another device, Device B, on the same LAN.
Device A checks its ARP cache, which is a table that stores recently looked up IP-to-MAC address mappings, to see if it already knows the MAC address of Device B.
If the mapping is not found in the ARP cache, Device A sends an ARP broadcast message to the LAN asking for the MAC address of Device B. This message is sent to the broadcast address of the LAN and is received by all devices on the network.
Device B, which has the IP address being looked up, receives the ARP broadcast and sends a reply to Device A with its MAC address.
Device A receives the reply and stores the IP-to-MAC address mapping in its ARP cache.
Device A can now send data to Device B using the MAC address it received in the ARP reply.
ARP is an important protocol in networking as it enables communication between devices on a LAN, but it is also vulnerable to ARP spoofing attack, where an attacker sends false ARP messages to map his own MAC address to the IP address of another device on the network, so that all the network traffic intended for the latter is sent to the attacker. This is known as ARP cache poisoning.
