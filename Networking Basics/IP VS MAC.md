MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are both unique identifiers used in networking, but they serve different purposes and have some key differences.

Purpose: MAC addresses are used for communication on a LAN (Local Area Network), while IP addresses are used for communication over a network, be it a LAN or the internet.
Scope: MAC addresses are used at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI Model and are specific to a LAN. IP addresses are used at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI Model and are used to route data packets between devices on different networks.
Format: MAC addresses are 48-bit unique identifiers that are usually written in the format of XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, where X can be any hexadecimal digit (0-9, A-F). IP addresses can be either IPv4 (32-bit) or IPv6 (128-bit) and are usually written in the format of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx for IPv4 and xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx for IPv6.
Assignment: MAC addresses are assigned by the manufacturer of the network interface and cannot be changed. IP addresses can be assigned dynamically by a DHCP server or can be manually configured by an administrator.
Security: MAC addresses are not routed over the internet, making them less vulnerable to spoofing attacks. IP addresses, on the other hand, can be spoofed, making them more vulnerable to attacks such as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) and man-in-the-middle attacks.
In summary, MAC addresses are used for communication on a LAN, while IP addresses are used for communication over networks. They have different formats, scopes, and purposes, and are assigned and used in different ways.
