A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network. It is also known as a Network Interface Controller (NIC), a LAN card, or a Network Adapter.

A NIC typically includes a connector for a cable that connects to the network, as well as the electronic components necessary to transmit and receive data over the network. The connector can be an RJ-45 connector for Ethernet networks, a USB connector, or a wireless connector.

The NIC also has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address, which is a unique 48-bit identifier assigned to the card by the manufacturer. The MAC address is used to identify the device on the network, and is necessary for the Media Access Control protocol to control access to the network.

A NIC can also include other features such as support for different types of networks (Ethernet, token ring, etc.), support for different speeds (10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps), support for different types of cabling (coaxial, twisted pair, fiber optic), and support for wireless communication.

NICs can be built into the motherboard of a computer or can be added as an expansion card. They can also be found in other network devices such as routers, switches, and access points.

It's worth noting that virtual NICs also exists, which are software-based NICs that are implemented in virtualized environments, such as VMs, to connect a virtual machine to a virtual network.
