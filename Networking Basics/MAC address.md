A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on a LAN (Local Area Network). It is a hardware address that is burned into the network interface card (NIC) during the manufacturing process.

A MAC address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number (48-bit) that is usually written in the format of XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, where X can be any hexadecimal digit (0-9, A-F).

The MAC address is used to identify a device on a LAN and is used by the Media Access Control protocol to control access to the network. It is used by the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to map an IP address to a physical address, allowing devices to communicate with each other on a LAN.

MAC addresses are unique and are assigned to the device by the manufacturer, and cannot be changed. This ensures that no two devices on the same network will have the same MAC address.

MAC addresses are also used by network routers and switches to forward data packets to the appropriate device on a network.

It's important to note that MAC addresses are specific to the LAN and are not routable over the interne
